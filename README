This node module can be used to order BTC from digitalX Direct API
based on the level of a given wallet balance. In config.json, set the
wallet address to be checked, the digitalX API key and secret, the value
below which to order more BTC ('threshold'), the minimum amount of minutes
that you want to pass before another order can be placed, and the max
price to tolerate. 

reorder.js is the main script, test_digitalx.js runs some test calls to the 
digitalX API, including a order for .001 to the user's default wallet.

Please direct all questions to neel@digitalx.com.
